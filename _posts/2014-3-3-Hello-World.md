Look forward to hearing more about things I like! 
Until then, enjoy this cake of London I made with one of my supervisors for the CASA Christmas bake-off:

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
