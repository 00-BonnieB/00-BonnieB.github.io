### More Information

My PhD will look at residential mobility and housing. The system of residential flows that result from the simultaneous transition of individuals through their own life stages and through the city is understood as Londonâ€™s metabolism. An underpinning assumption of the work is: as households move through the life cycle, their residential decisions interact with other housing demands in their vicinity and these together shape current and anticipated housing provisions. Migration patterns of households in small areas within London and the near commuter belt will be examined to articulate the role of the housing stock in individual migration decisions and model scenarios of change within boroughs.
